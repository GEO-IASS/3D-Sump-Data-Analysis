# 3D-Sump-Data-Analysis
Script Tools to analyize point cloud CMM data

This program is used to take CMM data (which has been pre-processed to remove extraneous labels and columns), and perform analysis on it.

The main program is specific to a certain part design, but the architecture is meant to be scaleable to any part that is being measured on our CMM.
